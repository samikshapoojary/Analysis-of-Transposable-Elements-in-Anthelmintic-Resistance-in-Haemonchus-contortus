## üìò Overview

This repository contains all scripts developed for the MSc Bioinformatics project *‚ÄúExploring the Role of Transposable Elements in Anthelmintic Resistance in Haemonchus contortus.‚Äù*  
All code is provided for reproducibility and as reference material.

The project investigates transposable element (TE) dynamics and their potential involvement in anthelmintic resistance, integrating results from **EarlGrey** and **PoPoolationTE2**, with supplementary RNA-seq workflows included in the appendix.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

### **A. Master Scripts**

#### `master_bash_script.sh`
Contains all Bash workflows used for:
- FASTQ header/format fixing  
- **EarlGrey** TE library generation  
- Filtering TE annotations  
- Preparing merged genome + TE FASTA and TE hierarchy file  
- **PoPoolationTE2** workflow (sample-level and joint analysis)  
- Overlap analysis with genes and UTRs  

#### `master_r_script.R`
Contains all R workflows used for:
- Parsing and cleaning TE annotation data  
- Summarising TE content across genomes  
- Plotting genome composition, TE landscapes, and distributions  
- Statistical analyses (logistic regression, PCA, UpSet plots, etc.)  

---

### **A.2. RNA-seq Scripts (Supplementary)**

#### `supp_rnaseq_bash.sh`
Contains RNA-seq analysis steps for:
- **STAR** genome index building  
- **RNA-seq read alignment**  
- **HTSeq-count** for read quantification  

> **Note:** RNA-seq steps were not part of the main thesis analysis but are included here as supplementary material for completeness.

## üß¨ Input Data

The project used the following genome assemblies and sequence datasets:

| Organism | Assembly ID | Source |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| *Haemonchus contortus* | PRJEB506 (WBPS18) | WormBase ParaSite |
| *Teladorsagia circumcincta* | WSI3.0 | WormBase ParaSite |
| *Caenorhabditis elegans* | PRJNA13758 (WBPS19) | WormBase ParaSite |

**Sequencing data:**
- 9 pooled genomic samples (Pool-seq)  
- RNA-seq FASTQ files (not analysed in final thesis)
- Pooled whole-genome sequencing (Pool-seq) data and RNA-seq datasets for control, ivermectin-resistant, and moxidectin-resistant Haemonchus contortus populations were obtained from the Centre for Genomic Research (CGR), University of Liverpool:
[Pool-seq](https://cgr.liv.ac.uk/illum/LIMS28593_fbc6c22b786c7600/) 
[RNA-seq](https://cgr.liv.ac.uk/illum/LIMS30731_cb27564db3511460/)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### **Genome & TE Analysis (Bash)**
Run `master_bash_script.sh`, executing each section corresponding to a specific analysis step (e.g., genome preparation, PoPoolationTE2 runs, feature overlap analysis).

### **R Analysis & Plotting**
Run `master_r_script.R` section by section in R or RStudio for data parsing, visualization, and statistical analysis.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è File paths within scripts are project-specific (e.g. `/Data3/samiksha/...`). Adjust paths according to your own environment before running.

---

## üßæ Notes

- The master scripts are concatenated versions of all smaller scripts used in the project for convenience and assessment.  
- It is recommended to execute each section separately rather than running the entire master file at once.  
- Data files (e.g. FASTQ, BAM, and intermediate results) are **not included** due to size constraints.
